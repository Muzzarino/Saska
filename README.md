# The Game (does not officially have a name quite yet...)
This repo is dedicated to the development of a multiplayer C++ game :
- the graphics will be done in Vulkan
- the networking stuff will be done in the Sockets API

I am currently in the stage of getting the graphics side of the application finished (it will take time ...)
